                <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
                <p>I live out in the Chicago suburbs, which is where I have been residing for the last 15 or so years! I have one twin sister, who attends the University of Iowa pursuing the Pre-Med track. Although it is hard being apart, we do call almost everyday so it is not the worst thing ever, but it is nice when we are able to see eachother.</p>
                <p>I have been apart of several athletics during my life so far, starting off with tennis, which was influenced by my mom who played tennis at Rutgers as a collegiate athlete. Although that path didn't last very long, I moved onto the path of soccer, which lasted around 11 years until the second year of high school. From there, I joined Cross Country and Track and Field, a path that lasted throughout the remaining years of my high school career.</p>
                <p>Once I got to Michigan State University to begin my college career, I tried hard to keep up the Cross Country and Track energy, but realized that Ultimate Frisbee was more the sport for me, leading me to join a mixed women's and men's club during the summer months when school was out of session.</p>
