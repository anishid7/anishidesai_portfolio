                Hello! I’m Anishi Desai, a dedicated professional passionate about leveraging technology and business insights to drive impactful solutions. Currently studying Information Science with a minor in Business at Michigan State University, I bring a blend of analytical skills, strategic thinking, and a collaborative approach to every opportunity. I’m excited to share my journey, experiences, and expertise across various topics in this portfolio.

                        As someone who loves tackling challenges, connecting with people, and finding creative ways to make a difference. I value curiosity and adaptability, which help me navigate life’s twists and turns with enthusiasm and an open mind. Whether I’m brainstorming ideas, working on personal projects, or collaborating with others, I enjoy bringing positivity and focus to whatever I do.

                        I’m drawn to experiences that spark growth and connection. I find joy in learning from different perspectives, exploring new places, and seeking out moments of inspiration. At my core, I believe in working hard, staying grounded, and celebrating the little wins along the way.
                    </p>

                        Outside of work, I enjoy diving into creative hobbies, trying new recipes, and spending time with those I hold close. One new hobby I've gotten into has been Ultimate Frisbee, which is a highly active and competitive team sport that has become a major source of activity and socialization for me. I just recently got into it last fall with the club team at my school, Michigan State, but it has been an amazing time ever since. My goal is always to balance ambition with mindfulness, striving to grow while appreciating the present.
