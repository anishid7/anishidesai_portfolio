                Over the past few years, I have gained diverse experience in business technology and supply chain management, working on a variety of impactful projects. This hands-on experience has allowed me to develop a strong skill set in process optimization, project management, and cross-functional collaboration, while continuously refining my ability to leverage technology to drive business improvements. My time at AbbVie has been particularly instrumental in helping me build a foundation for solving complex problems and contributing to large-scale initiatives.

                <p>I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Information Science at Michigan State University, with a minor in Business. Throughout my time at MSU, I have been actively involved in various student organizations that align with my interests and academic pursuits.

As a member, I engage in discussions, workshops, and projects that delve into AIâ€™s current and future applications across several industries. The club also provides opportunities to collaborate with like-minded peers, allowing me to expand my understanding of this rapidly evolving field.</li>
                    <li class="edu-li"><span class="bold-text">UI/UX Club: </span>This club primarily focuses on the principles of user interface and user experience design. We work on real-world projects, learning about design thinking, user research, prototyping, and usability testing. Additionally, we collaborate with local businesses to help improve their digital products, allowing us to gain hands-on experience while contributing to meaningful projects.</li>
                    <li class="edu-li"><span class="bold-text">Women's Ultimate Frisbee Club: </span>This club offers a supportive and fun environment where we practice and compete in ultimate frisbee. I've only been playing this sport for around a year or so, but it has become a significant part of my life for balancing my educational life versus my social life and overall health. As I have been apart of team sports before this one, being able to reignite the spark of competition and teamwork has allowed me to utilize those skills outside of this environment, making it easier for me to connect with others and build leadership skills.</li>

Each position has helped me not only network outside of my immediate age group, but also become more confident in the path I am now on with my studies.
