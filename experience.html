                Over the past few years, I have gained diverse experience in business technology and supply chain management, working on a variety of impactful projects. This hands-on experience has allowed me to develop a strong skill set in process optimization, project management, and cross-functional collaboration, while continuously refining my ability to leverage technology to drive business improvements. My time at AbbVie has been particularly instrumental in helping me build a foundation for solving complex problems and contributing to large-scale initiatives.

                            <p class="job-desc">
                                During this internship, I worked closely with AbbVie’s supply chain team on digitalization projects. One of my main responsibilities was leading decommissioning projects, where I worked to retire old systems and processes. This involved analyzing current workflows, identifying inefficiencies, and helping create smoother, more modern systems to replace them. I also got the chance to collaborate with global teams, which gave me insight into how supply chains operate on an international scale.</p>
                            <p class="job-desc">
                                What I loved most about this role was the problem-solving aspect. Every day, I faced new challenges—whether it was figuring out the best way to streamline a process or learning how to manage technical tools effectively. I also gained a better understanding of how technology supports supply chain operations and helps teams make smarter, faster decisions.
                            </p>
                            <p class="job-desc">
                                This role showed me that I enjoy working in a space where business and technology come together. It made me realize that I like improving systems, creating efficiencies, and helping people work better. It’s why I’ve grown so interested in roles where I can combine data analysis, technology, and strategy.

                                As an IT/Operations intern, I focused on supporting business technology systems, specifically within supply chain and global digital logistics. My role here was to ensure that technology solutions worked well for the teams relying on them. I worked on projects like system upgrades, troubleshooting issues, and finding ways to make the systems more user-friendly.
                            </p>
                            <p class="job-desc">
                                A big part of this experience was learning to bridge the gap between IT and business. I had to talk to technical teams about what was happening behind the scenes while also explaining technical concepts to people in business terms. I discovered how important clear communication is and how it helps build trust between teams.
                            </p>
                            <p class="job-desc">
                                This internship taught me how technology powers business operations and how crucial it is to make systems reliable and efficient. It deepened my interest in roles where I can bring technical solutions to business problems. It also helped me understand how much I enjoy collaborating with different departments to achieve a common goal.
